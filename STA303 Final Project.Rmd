_You can delete this section, and if you want to check what it said, just open a template from the package again. You don't have to use this particular template, but you DO need to write you report in RMarkdown and include a cover page._

_The cover page must have:_

*	_A title and subtitle_
* _"Report prepared for Black Saber Software by" your company name_
*	_Date (assessment submission date is fine)_

_You can change the colour of this cover to any colour you would like by replacing 6C3082 in the YAML above (line 11) to another hex code. You could use this tool to help you:_ https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/

# Executive summary

_Guidelines for the executive summary:_

* _No more than two pages_
* _Language is appropriate for a non-technical audience_
* _Bullet points are used where appropriate_
*	_A small number of key visualizations and/or tables are included_
*	_All three research questions are addressed_


\newpage
# Technical report
_This part of the report is much more comprehensive than the executive summary. The audience is statistics/data-minded people, but you should NOT include code or unformatted R output here._


## Introduction

_Provide a brief introduction to your report and outline what the report will cover. This section is valuable for setting scope and expectations. _
The present report investigates whether employees in Black Saber Software gets hired, promoted, and receives salary by their talents and values to the company, with a special focus on gender biases exist in any of these processes. 


### Research questions
_Use bullet points to to describe the research questions you are going to address. Write in full sentences._
1) Salary: The purpose of this survey is to explore factors related to increase rate(amount) of salary by every quarter(?). What kind of employees on this company get a higher salary when the quarter changes? What factors, such as gender, team, role, leadership level, productivity, are related to increased rate of salary? Among those who get a higher salary compared to the previous quarter, to what extent is gender associated with salary increase rate? It is commonly assumed that males have more advantages than females. Is this true on Black Saber Software? 

2) 
Promotion: The purpose of this survey is to explore factors related to promotion. What kind of employees on this company are promoted? What factors, such as gender, team, role, leadership level, productivity, are related to whether employees are promoted? Among those who promoted, to what extent is gender associated with promotion status? It is commonly assumed that males have more advantages than females. Is this true on Black Saber Software?


3) Hiring process: The purpose of this survey is to see whether there is gender bias throughout the hiring phase (This can be a general question). Then (as specific questions), we can see whether there is bias within algorithms AND humans (the recruiters and interviewers?). 





## Informative title for section addressing a research question(SALARY)

_For each research question, you will want to briefly describe any data manipulation, show some exploratory plots/summary tables, report on any methods you use (i.e. models you fit) and the conclusions you draw from these_

lmtest::lrtest(salary_lmer, salary_lmer_no_gender)
#conclusion: indeed, becuase the p-value is significant, simpler model does NOT explain better than complex model = should include gender to have better predictive ability...

##############################Should employee_id also be a random intercept?#########################
#data is inherently nested data becuase same employee's data is collected several times in different quarters.
#HOWEVER, in some sense, employee_is is nested in financial_q (refer to week5 quiz tomatoes question). Then, we dont need to include it becuase it would be duplicate. However, this only holds when the explanatory variables are kept the same, but role_seniority changes due to promotion when financial_q changes.

## modeling

### phase 1
```{r}
#use generalized linear model since all variables take large part of grades

#In model0, cannot see significant p-value 
#model where gender is only predictor
model0 <- glm(phase1accepted ~ gender, family = binomial, data = phase1_applicants_cleaned)
summary(model0)

model1 <- glm(phase1accepted ~ team_applied_for + cover_letter + cv+ gpa + extracurriculars + work_experience, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = phase1_applicants_cleaned)

model2_w_gender <- glm(phase1accepted ~ team_applied_for + cover_letter + cv+ gpa + gender +  extracurriculars + work_experience, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = phase1_applicants_cleaned)

drop_in_deviance <- anova(model1, model2_w_gender, test = "Chisq")
drop_in_deviance
```

Since confidence interval of all genders includes 0, at the 95% confidence level, it is believable that male applicants and female applicants with applicants who prefer not to say gender have the same odds of accepted by AI in phase 1. We will see more carefully that AI is biased with gender with other variables in phase 1.

The deviance test tells us that it is not preferable that adding gender as an indicator variable to the model. The deviance difference between models with gender and without gender is 1.21, which is pretty small. Also, the large p-value also supports that adding new indicator variable, which is gender, to the model with all the other variables is not helpful.

### phase 3
```{r}
model0_3 <- glm(hired ~ interviewer_rating_1 + interviewer_rating_2, data = phase3_applicants_cleaned)
model1_3 <- glm(hired ~ interviewer_rating_1 + interviewer_rating_2 + gender, data = phase3_applicants_cleaned)
anova(model0_3, model1_3, test = "Chisq")
```

The deviance test tells us that it is not preferable that adding gender as an indicator variable to the model. The deviance difference between models with gender and without gender is 0.23, which is pretty small. Even though the p-value is not that big, we can still say model with gender does not gives better prediction for hiring results in the interview in phase 3.

## Discussion

_In this section you will summarize your findings across all the research questions and discuss the strengths and limitations of your work. It doesn't have to be long, but keep in mind that often people will just skim the intro and the discussion of a document like this, so make sure it is useful as a semi-standalone section (doesn't have to be completely standalone like the executive summary)._

## Consultant profiles

*Complete this section with a brief bio for each member of your group. If you are completing the project individually, you only need to complete one for yourself. In that case, change the title of this section to 'Consultant profile' instead. Examples below. This section is only marked for completeness, clarity and professionalism, not 'truth' so you can write it as if we're a few years in the future. Put your current degree in as completed and/or add your first choice grad school program, whatever you like. What skills related skills would you most like to highlight? What job title do you want?*

## Code of ethical conduct

_This section should be fairly short, no more than half a page. Assume a general audience, much like your executive summary._

* _Make at least three relevant statements about your company’s approach to ethical statistical consulting. These should be appropriately in line with professional conduct advice like the (Statistical Society of Canada Code of Conduct)[https://ssc.ca/sites/default/files/data/Members/public/Accreditation/ethics_e.pdf] or the (Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice from the American Statistical Society)[https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx]. For example, "the customer is always right" ISN’T the type of thing an ethical statistical consultant would include._

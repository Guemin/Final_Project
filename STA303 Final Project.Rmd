# Technical report
_This part of the report is much more comprehensive than the executive summary. The audience is statistics/data-minded people, but you should NOT include code or unformatted R output here._


## Introduction

_Provide a brief introduction to your report and outline what the report will cover. This section is valuable for setting scope and expectations. _
The present report investigates whether employees in Black Saber Software gets hired, promoted, and receives salary by their talents and values to the company, with a special focus on gender biases exist in any of these processes. 


### Research questions
_Use bullet points to to describe the research questions you are going to address. Write in full sentences._

-Salary: The focus of our question regarding salary was whether employees receives their salary purely based on their values to the company. In particular, we were interested in whether gender has significant influence on the salary when we fit a regression model and set salary as response since if gender does have significant influence, it would be an indication that the Black Saber Software company differentially distributes salary to employees based on their gender.

What kind of employees on this company get a higher salary when the quarter changes? What factors, such as gender, team, role, leadership level, productivity, are related to increased rate of salary? Among those who get a higher salary compared to the previous quarter, to what extent is gender associated with salary increase rate? It is commonly assumed that males have more advantages than females. Is this true on Black Saber Software? 

2) 
Promotion: What factors, such as gender, leadership level, and productivity, are potentially affecting the number of promotions of employees at the Black Saber Software? Is the common assumption that male employees are more likely to be promoted than female employees also true at the Black Saber Software?

3) Hiring process: The purpose of this survey is to see whether there is gender bias throughout the hiring phase (This can be a general question). Then (as specific questions), we can see whether there is bias within algorithms AND humans (the recruiters and interviewers?). 





## A Potential Gender Bias in Salary
_For each research question, you will want to briefly describe any data manipulation, show some exploratory plots/summary tables, report on any methods you use (i.e. models you fit) and the conclusions you draw from these_

We first changed the salary variable in black_saber_current_employees.csv file from characters to doubles so that we can fit a regression model with the salary variable as a response. We removed the dollar sign in the front and a comma sign that separates the thousands value. Then, we reordered the factor level of the employee's seniority of role such that it matches the actual hierarchy in the company rather than alphabetical order. We also set woman as the baseline for gender variable so that we can make compairsons of salary and promotion by gender easily (see appendix for more information).

```


Based on the data of current employees that we received,  leadership level, and productivity of an employee seemed to be the variables that describes the employee's value to the company. However, we also suspected that team and seniority of role will also have fixed effect on salary since based on those variables, the employee will have differential value to the company:
For team, some team might be important and valuable to the company because Black Saber is a software company.
For seniority of role, the higher position an employee takes, the more challenging work they have to do. 
To figure out whether such sepculation is true, we fitted a boxplot. 


```{r}
#########################################################################################################
#EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
#########################################################################################################
# create a visualisation (a boxplot to see if teams have systematic differences in their salary)
#rationale is that 


#exploring whether there is difference in salary by roles and by teams.
#there should be difference, since higher the role, the more salary people earn since they are more valuable to the company
#andsome teams might be more important to the company 
#e.g., bc it is a software company, software team might be more valuable to the company and thus receive higher salary, yet is fair in the sense that the Gideon wants salary based on "talent and value to the company”)

my_plot_salary_by_role_team <- black_saber_current_employees_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = role_seniority, y = salary, color = Team)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Boxplots for Salary by Seniority of Role", x="Role Seniority", y= "Salary($)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = c(0.15, 0.65)) 

my_plot_salary_by_role_team

ggsave("images/salary_boxplot_role_team.png", width = 8, height = 6)

#side note: does follow the seniority trend, which is Least senior to most senior: “Entry-level”,“Junior I”,“JuniorII”,“Senior I”,“Senior II”,“Senior III”,“Manager”, “Director”,“Vicepresident”

```

![](images/salary_boxplot_role_team.png)
Indeed, we see that salary significantly depends on the person's role seniority level as well as the team they are in. In particular, manager, director, vice president receives salaries significantly different from other positions, the software teams generally receives higher salary than other teams as we can see from the pink boxplots. Thus, we will also include team and seniority or role as predictors to a regression model.

Below is a boxplot of whether there is a gender difference in salary. Although it does not seem to have sysemtatic difference, when we ran one-way anova setting gender as predictor and salary as response, there was a significant difference (see appendix), but we do need to consider other variables that contributes to the employee's value to the company. Thus, we will see whether a regression model with and without gender as predictor significantly differs after we fit a model and make compairson.

```{r}
#########################################################################################################

#exploring whether there is gender difference in salary
my_plot_salary_by_gender <- black_saber_current_employees_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = salary)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Boxplots for Salary by Gender", x = "Gender", y= "Salary($)")
  
my_plot_salary_by_gender
#result(interpretation of the plot): Gender does not seem to have fixed effect on salary. In other words, no gender bias, which is good considering EDI (but when doing model comparison, we will see whether such is true numerically)

ggsave("images/salary_boxplot_gender.png", width = 8, height = 6)

#########ONE-WAY ANOVA ON SALARY AND GENDER AS GROUP####################

lmod_gender <- lm(salary ~ gender, data = black_saber_current_employees_cleaned)
summary(lmod_gender)
#HOWEVER, UNLIKE THE VISUALIZATION, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN GENDER! THERE MIGHT BE GENDER BIAS IN SALARY(we will see this in model fitting part)

```
![](images/salary_boxplot_gender.png)



For a linear regression model, we chose linear mixed effects model because financial quarter will also produce sysemtatic difference, since in financial quarters where Black Saber earns a lot of money, employees will receive bonus, for instance. However, we are not interested in this variable because we only care about the employee's value and so we added this as random intercept.

```{r}
#########################################################################################################
#MODEL FITTING
#########################################################################################################

#fitting a linear mixed model while setting financial quarter (financial_q)
#rationale: in some quarters, the company earns a lot of money and so all employees earn more money in that quarter, but when the quarter is not good, all earn less money.

salary_lmer <- lmer(salary ~ gender + Team + role_seniority + leadership_for_level + productivity + (1|financial_q), data = black_saber_current_employees_cleaned)
#summary(salary_lmer)

#cannot take face-value to whether team has systematic difference and so just to check, we added this model without team so that when we compare it with salary_lmer, we can know whether we must include team or not fpre better prediction.
salary_lmer_no_team <- lmer(salary ~ gender + role_seniority + leadership_for_level + productivity + (1|financial_q), data = black_saber_current_employees_cleaned)
#summary(salary_lmer)

salary_lmer_no_gender <- lmer(salary ~ Team + role_seniority + leadership_for_level + productivity + (1|financial_q), data = black_saber_current_employees_cleaned)
#summary(salary_lmer_no_gender)

```

Below is the result of maximum likelihood test with and without gender as predictor. Since the p-value is significant, we have no evidence against the claim that simpler model is better. In other words, we should go with the complex model, which is the model that includes gender as predictor, to have better predictive ability for salary. This result implicates that gender cause notable difference in salary and so there is indeed a gender bias in salary.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#########################################################################################################
#MODEL COMPARISION TEST
#########################################################################################################


#THIS TEST CONFRIMS THAT THERE IS A GENDER BIAS IN SALARY
lmtest::lrtest(salary_lmer, salary_lmer_no_gender)
#conclusion: indeed, becuase the p-value is significant, simpler model does NOT explain better than complex model = should include gender to have better predictive ability...

```
Note that we also tested whether we should include team as predictor for salary becuase it might be ambiguous of whether team has fixed effect on salary based on the above plot as compared to seniority of role. The result showed that we should also include team (see appendix).
```{r}
#This test confirms that we need team as predictor
lmtest::lrtest(salary_lmer, salary_lmer_no_team)
```

In conclusion, there is a gender bias in salary since gender improves salary prediction above and beyond inclusion  of other variables, which are the factors that show the employee's value to Black Saber Software.

## modeling

### phase 1
```{r}
#use generalized linear model since all variables take large part of grades

#In model0, cannot see significant p-value 
#model where gender is only predictor
model0 <- glm(phase1accepted ~ gender, family = binomial, data = phase1_applicants_cleaned)
summary(model0)

model1 <- glm(phase1accepted ~ team_applied_for + cover_letter + cv+ gpa + extracurriculars + work_experience, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = phase1_applicants_cleaned)

model2_w_gender <- glm(phase1accepted ~ team_applied_for + cover_letter + cv+ gpa + gender +  extracurriculars + work_experience, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = phase1_applicants_cleaned)

drop_in_deviance <- anova(model1, model2_w_gender, test = "Chisq")
drop_in_deviance
```

Since confidence interval of all genders includes 0, at the 95% confidence level, it is believable that male applicants and female applicants with applicants who prefer not to say gender have the same odds of accepted by AI in phase 1. We will see more carefully that AI is biased with gender with other variables in phase 1.

The deviance test tells us that it is not preferable that adding gender as an indicator variable to the model. The deviance difference between models with gender and without gender is 1.21, which is pretty small. Also, the large p-value also supports that adding new indicator variable, which is gender, to the model with all the other variables is not helpful.

### phase 3
```{r}
model0_3 <- glm(hired ~ interviewer_rating_1 + interviewer_rating_2, data = phase3_applicants_cleaned)
model1_3 <- glm(hired ~ interviewer_rating_1 + interviewer_rating_2 + gender, data = phase3_applicants_cleaned)
anova(model0_3, model1_3, test = "Chisq")
```

The deviance test tells us that it is not preferable that adding gender as an indicator variable to the model. The deviance difference between models with gender and without gender is 0.23, which is pretty small. Even though the p-value is not that big, we can still say model with gender does not gives better prediction for hiring results in the interview in phase 3.

These should be appropriately in line with professional conduct advice like the (Statistical Society of Canada Code of Conduct)[https://ssc.ca/sites/default/files/data/Members/public/Accreditation/ethics_e.pdf] or the (Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice from the American Statistical Society)[https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx]. For example, "the customer is always right" ISN’T the type of thing an ethical statistical consultant would include._
*	_Be very careful not to just copy and paste from these other documents! Put things in your own words._


__Final advice: KNIT EARLY AND OFTEN!__
